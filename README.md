# Find A Coffee Partner or Lunch Group!


## Description
This application helps find the user a coffee partner or lunch group. The user can only go to coffee with each "coworker" once to learn his/her favorite coffee. For lunch groups, this user can generate an unlimited amount of lunch groups but they are prioritized by who most recently went to lunch with the user.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
## Further Considerations
- Break some of the code into separate components (user list)
- Utilize Vuex to keep track of states among the application
